# Caffe matlab interface demo wrapper
The matlab interface provided by caffe can not run directly, So I wrote this bash script to run it more convenient.

Before running this scipt, make sure that you have Cuda, Caffe installed correctly, and matcaffe compiled successfully.

bvlc_reference_caffenet.caffemodel should have downloaded.

Feel free to change the $CUDA_LIB and $LD_PRELOAD according to your system environment.
